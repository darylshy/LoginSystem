### A very basic Angular 1.5 project.  
***
~~A simple personal information form~~
~~Adds User's personal info to a small card~~
~~Outputs it on the DOM~~  
Changed to a login system
+ Takes in personal information
+ Outputs information to a a card to be verified
+ Offers two options
  - Verify
    * Verifying routes to the login page
  - Edit
    * Editing removes the card from the DOM and allows you to edit the original form
+ Added a new branch *verify_modal* to use a pop-up modal as an alternative flow for the verification part of the app.
***
On the login page, you just enter in the information and once verified a message will appear
*form validation not worked out compoletely as of yet*

**NOT OPTIMIZED FOR MOBILE**  

***
+ npm install  
+ npm start  
*Uses lite-server*
